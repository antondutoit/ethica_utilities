title: "Ethica output cleaning and variable renaming"
# To use this script with your data files, change the file path on line 56 to point at the folder with your data files. The files must be in CSV format. The script will output a dataframe for each CSV file; dataframes will be named Survey.Number_df. The dataframe will have clean numerical output for single-answer questions, and also will have all variables renamed as Survey.Number_Question.Number_Question.Type. If you want a CSV file outputted as well, you could use write.csv(your_df, file = "C:/your_file_path/your_filename.csv", na = ""). 

output:
  html_notebook: default
  html_document:
    df_print: paged
  pdf_document: default

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
